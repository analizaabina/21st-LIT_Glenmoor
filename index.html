        <p><strong>Biag Ni Lam-Ang</strong> by Pedro Bucaneg reflects the core traits, values, and customs of the Filipino people. It is not only a reflection of the courage, commitment, and determination of its heroes but also the ideals, perspectives, and customs that our ancestors left behind. This legendary tale, that dates back to the pre-Spanish era and is based on the Ilocanos' practices, gives insight into the identity, knowledge, and lifestyle of the early Filipino people. It reflects how the previous people who came before us influenced our history and culture through its incredible adventures. It showcases undying courage, fairness, affection, romanticism, connection, voyage, and camaraderie. The story contains idealistic fantasies and elements of greatness and bravery. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biag_ni_Lam-ang" target="_blank">Read more about Biag Ni Lam-Ang</a>.</p>

        <h2>Colonial Period</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Doctrina-cristiana.jpg" alt="Doctrina Cristiana">
        <p><strong>Doctrina Cristiana</strong> by Juan de Plasencia is an important document drawn from the pen of Juan de Plasencia in the late 16th century, summarizing such relationships between religion, colonialism, and Philippine culture. As a Franciscan missionary, Plasencia aimed at delivering the Christian principles that the native people could relate to and understand. This is a poem that voices the complexity of the colonial contact between European missionaries and indigenous tribes, but in itself serves as a cultural document as well as a philosophical guide. The "Doctrina Cristiana" became a critical part of the introduction process of Christianity in the Philippines and also an example to other missionary ventures. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrina_Christiana" target="_blank">Read more about Doctrina Cristiana</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Justice: Selected Essays 1968-1994</strong> by NVM Gonzales focuses on the Filipino identity and the sociopolitical milieu in the Philippines in trying historical circumstances. The pieces hence don the robes of literature in interpreting and articulating cultural identity, social justice, political commentary, memory and history, transformational power of literature, and power of literature in social change. Gonzales critiques inequality and emphasizes the transformative power of literature in addressing societal issues and fostering change. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26148126-justice-selected-essays-1968-1994" target="_blank">Read more about Justice: Selected Essays</a>.</p>
